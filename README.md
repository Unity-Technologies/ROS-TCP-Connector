# ROS-TCP-Connector

Scripts used to send [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) messages to an [TCP endpoint](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS_TCP_Endpoint) running as a ROS node.

This Unity package provides three main features:

- ROSConnection: See the [Unity Robotics Hub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub/blob/master/tutorials/ros_unity_integration/README.md) repository for information and tutorials on how to use this component.

- [Message Generation](MessageGeneration.md)

- [ROSGeometry](ROSGeometry.md)

## ROS#

Special thanks to the Siemens [ROS# Project Team]( https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/wiki/Info_Acknowledgements) for driving the ROS-Unity Integration Open Source since 2017.

This repo is a fork of [ROS#](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp) and was a great starting point for our development.
