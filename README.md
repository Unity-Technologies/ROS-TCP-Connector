## Introduction

This repository contains two Unity packages: the ROS TCP Connector, for sending/receiving messages from ROS, and the Visualizations Package, for adding visualizations of incoming and outgoing messages in the Unity scene.

## Installation
1. Using Unity 2020.2 or later, open the Package Manager from `Window` -> `Package Manager`.
2. In the Package Manager window, find and click the + button in the upper lefthand corner of the window. Select `Add package from git URL....`

3. Enter the git URL for the desired package. Note: you can append a version tag to the end of the git url, like `#v0.4.0` or `#v0.5.0`, to declare a specific package version, or exclude the tag to get the latest from the package's `main` branch.
    1. For the ROS-TCP-Connector, enter `https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS-TCP-Connector.git?path=/com.unity.robotics.ros-tcp-connector`.
    2. For Visualizations, enter `https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS-TCP-Connector.git?path=/com.unity.robotics.visualizations`.
4. Click `Add`.

To install from a local clone of the repository, see [installing a local package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-local.html) in the Unity manual.

## Tutorials
<!-- Scripts used to send [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) messages to an [TCP endpoint](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS_TCP_Endpoint) running as a ROS node. -->

This Unity package provides four main features:

- ROSConnection: A component that sets up communication between ROS and Unity. See the [Unity Robotics Hub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub/blob/main/tutorials/ros_unity_integration/README.md) for information and tutorials.

- [Message Generation](MessageGeneration.md): A tool to generate C# classes for ROS message types.

- Visualizations: A suite of default configurations and APIs to visualize incoming and outgoing information from ROS.
    - See the [Nav2 SLAM Example](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Robotics-Nav2-SLAM-Example) for tutorials on using the Visualizations Package!
    - You can also view the package's [Usage Information](com.unity.robotics.visualizations/Documentation~/README.md) for more details on using the package in your own project.

- [ROSGeometry](ROSGeometry.md): A set of extensions that convert geometries between Unity and other coordinate frames.
